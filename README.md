Running examples based on ``Using change in a seat belt law to study racially-biased policing in South Carolina"" by Corinne A Riddell, Jay S Kaufman, Jacqueline M Torres, and Sam Harper [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3066482.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3066482) 


We'll be going through examples in first in "Code/traffic_stop_analysis" and then in "Code/arrest_analysis". Follow along with the Rmd files or see the code and output without running anything by looking at the md files.
